Welcome to my GitHub account! âœ¨

I do not have any major projects here yet, just some small ones from stuff I did during my studies.
Currently I am doing a Nanodegree in **Data Engineering** at Udacity, learning about super cool things like:
- Data Modeling âœ”ï¸Ž
- Data Warehouses
- Data Lakes
- Data Pipelines

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
